🚌 Smart Bus Navigation (DSA Project)

A Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) based simulation project that models a city bus transport system.
It demonstrates practical usage of fundamental data structures such as Graph, Queue, Stack, Linked List, Sorting, and Hashing.

🚀 Features

📍 City Graph:

  Represents bus stops and routes using adjacency lists.
  
  Supports shortest path calculation using Dijkstra’s Algorithm.

⏰ Bus Scheduling:

  Stores bus schedules (ID, departure time, routes).
  
  Implements Bubble Sort & Selection Sort for departure time ordering.

👥 Passenger Management:

  Passenger Queue at each stop using Queue.
  
  Passengers linked with details using Linked List.

🚌 Bus Events (Stack):

  Track bus events like arrival, departure, maintenance using Stack.
  
  Supports push, pop, and peek.

🔍 Bus Lookup (Hash Table):

  Quick search for bus details.

📖 Learning Outcomes

  Practical application of DSA concepts.
  
  Real-world simulation of transport & scheduling system.
  
  Strong resume project to showcase problem-solving skills.
